- Accent color: Lavender (#E6E6FA), a light tint of the primary color, to highlight interactive elements and call-to-actions.
- Secondary Color: Light Gray (#D3D3D3), a neutral tone derived from the primary color, for subtle backgrounds and dividers.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and short amounts of body text, and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for longer body text.
- Utilize a set of minimalist icons for skills and project categories.
- Single-page layout with clear section divisions and a responsive design to ensure optimal viewing across devices.
- Incorporate subtle transition effects when scrolling between sections to enhance user experience without being distracting.
